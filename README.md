### Welcome

I am currently a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design pursuing a Master of City Planning. As an experienced climate adaptation & resilience practitioner, I have expertise in assessing vulnerabilities, managing risks, and identifying opportunities to advance resilient infrastructure. I am committed to building more effective and equitable pathways to long-term resilience.
